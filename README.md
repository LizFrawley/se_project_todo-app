# Simple Todo App

This is the ToDo App. It allows a user to add or remove todos from their list as well as add a due date to each seperate todo, and mark the todos as complete.

## Functionality
The Simple Todo App enables users to efficiently manage their daily tasks. Users can:

- **Add new todos:** Enter a task description and optionally set a due date.
- **View todos:** See a list of all current tasks, each displaying its description and due date.
- **Mark as complete:** Indicate when a task is finished, visually distinguishing completed items.
- **Remove todos:** Delete tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- **Edit todos:** Update the description or due date of existing tasks.

The app provides a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy to keep track of tasks and deadlines.

## Technology

I used JavaScript a lot for this project. The HTML and CSS were already written out for this one since it was mostly designed to help students work on their JavaScript skills.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
